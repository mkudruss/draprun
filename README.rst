Purpose
=======

The purpose of this tool is to allow its use to
 - Draw simple graphs, whose elements can be tagged and linked to other data
 - Program scripts around the graph
 - Run these scripts to perform various activities

This is a sandbox to experiment with GUI programming and some well-know paradigms.
